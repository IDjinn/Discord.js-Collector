            // Before
                ReactionCollector.question({
                    botMessage,
                    user: message.author,
                    reactions: {
                        '✅': async (reaction, ...args) => await message.channel.delete(),
                        '❌': async (reaction, ...args) => await message.reply('Ok, operation cancelled!'),
                    }
                },
                'you', 'args', 'here');

            // After
                ReactionCollector.question({
                    botMessage,
                    user: message.author,
                    reactions: {
                        '✅': async (reaction, collector, ...args) => await message.channel.delete(),
                        '❌': async (reaction, collector, ...args) => {
                            collector.stop(); // Stop reaction collector please!
                            await message.reply('Ok, operation cancelled!');
                        }
                    }
